summary(model) # in the model if intercept is -ve and slope is + u know that the e^value can be zero so the curve will cross 1/2. and u can breath a lil over it
# we choose the gpa instead or gre coz when v run the model with all the values v see that we will have to do lot more in moving the gre score than gpa and based on the values u get in the 1st model u can decide which variable is more effect on the model than the other.
